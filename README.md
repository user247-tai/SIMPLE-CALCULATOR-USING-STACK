# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR-USING-STACK
This project builds a simple calculator using Stack to be able to calculate mathematical expressions (not simply calculating 2 numbers).
For example: this calculator can calculate a mathematical expression like (A*B-C, A*B+C*D, A+B+D, A-B-D-C, ...) by using Stack & Reverse Polish notation in mathematics and computer sciences

Note that the "." BUTTON is use to CLEAR the LCD
